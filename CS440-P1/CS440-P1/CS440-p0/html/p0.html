<p>Yes, I know this page is lame, but that's what happens at 10:20 PM. Don't worry, though. I still love the class.</p>

<h2 align="center">ANYWAY</h2>

<p>As you can tell, something is rather off with my bottom images. I don't wear purple shirts! What I did was rather simple. You see, it was a basic shift! A normal image is mapped as a set of combinations of Red, Green, and Blue. To make my modification, I just shuffled them around a little, such that: </p>
	<ul style="text-align:center;">
	<li>Red --> Blue</li>
	<li>Blue --> Green</li>
	<li>Green --> Red</li>
	</ul>
<p>	Why would I do this, you may ask? The better question is... why not? Colors are fun, whether they're in a chem lab or a computer screen. Hell, they're even more fun if they're in your head! So go ahead and try it out, but be careful lest you fall down the rabbit hole.</p>
